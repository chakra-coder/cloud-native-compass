# A/B Testing

A/B testing is an approach to testing a hypothesis by creating a control group and introducing variant scenarios, functionality, appearance, et. al.,  and measuring the reactions across the scenarios against an intended reaction.

 test two application versions at the same time. For example, by splitting the traffic 50/50 between the two versions you are able to determine which version is more popular, faster, a better fit, etc. â€¦ whichever criteria you have determined are more important.

For example, a web site might experiment with a different layout. While unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing may be successful, determining if the layout is more popular or results in more leads/orders/profits/etc. Is done by A/B testing with the previous layout. In this scenario it is common to randomly split web traffic between the two layouts.

In a microservices context, A/B testing directs traffic randomly between the two versions and logs, traces and monitoring are used to determine which is better.
