# API Management

API management is the practice of taking an active ownership of your APIs. Management tools may include: rate limits, a dashboard, analytics, tools for monetization, authentication, onboarding, documentation and a developer portal.

API Management is critical to  maintaining control over an application. Preventing overuse, blocking DDoS attacks, monitoring traffic, billing, etc. are the responsibility of the service owner. API management enables a team to own their service and its performance.
