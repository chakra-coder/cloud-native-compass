# Domain-Driven Design

Domain Driven Design (DDD) is a system analysis methodology where the needs of the underlying business entity or function drives the outcome of the system construction.

In DDD, the solution -- one or more microservices -- is built to address only the problems presented by the domain it models. Everything in the solution is within the context of the domain, and all terms are likewise related. This is addressed by the following four characteristics of DDD:

Bounded Context
Domain
Model
Ubiquitous Language
