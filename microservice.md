# Microservice

A microservice is a very small web service that represents part of the bounded context as part of a larger system. In a microservices architectural style, the many small services work in concert to provide the larger, overall solution.

Microservices are autonomous, independent of other services. They also utilize their own data store(s). A microservice is constructed and supported by a small team (see 2-Pizza Team) which choose the programming language and libraries to use.

Code reuse is not emphasized in the microservices architecture, as each team should stand on its own.

Microservices should support the following concepts:
* Centralized logging
* Monitoring
* Uses its own local database
* Depends upon its own construction and support decisions
