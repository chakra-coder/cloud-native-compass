# Orchestration

The automated practice of getting all the pieces of a software system to work together. This includes assembling the correct pieces, constructing the system, and managing the results -- all through software. A fourth aspect of orchestration is to maintain a system in its desired state.

Using orchestration, as system is defined in a declarative language, with an underlying automated process carrying out any instructions necessary to reach and maintain the state defined.

The goals of orchestration are to have a Single Source of Truth for any systemâ€™s architecture and a zero-touch process to reaching, maintaining, and changing the system.
