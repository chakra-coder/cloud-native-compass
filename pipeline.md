# Pipeline

An environment of automated steps to move an application from development through testing and into staging and, eventually, into production. An automated pipeline allows for the implementation of a CI/CD system. The most widely-used CI/CD tool is Jenkins, an open source software product that allows you to build a pipeline that includes automated builds, automated testing, and either automated or manual delivery or deployment.
