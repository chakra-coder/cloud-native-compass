# Service Virtualization

Service virtualization is a technique used to emulate the behavior of dependencies of component-based applications. Although generally speaking, these dependencies are usually REST API-based services in a microservices architecture, the concept can also be applied to any other kinds of dependencies such as databases, ESB, Web Services, JMS, or any other system that communicates using messaging protocols.
