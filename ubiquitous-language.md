# Ubiquitous Language

All terms are related to the domain and have a meaning that is understood by all parties involved within the domain.

For example: The term “run” can have several meanings. It may be a verb, as when a person runs. It may also be a noun, but with many meanings. A run in a card game, a run in a stocking, a run in a manufacturing facility, a run in a baseball game, etc. The Context determines the meaning of this Ubiquitous Language, as determined by the Domain in which we are dealing. How a run is modeled in a system (the Model) is based on this knowledge.

When these four factors are applied, we are then able to construct microservices to implement a solution.
